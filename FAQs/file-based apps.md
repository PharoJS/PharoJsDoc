# How Do I Build File-based PharoJS Apps?

PharoJS apps are entry point classes. They inherit from classes in the `PjApplication` hierarch. One of subclasses is `PjFileBasedWebApp` that expects you have an `index.html` file in the app folder. The html must load `index.js` which is generated by PharoJS from your app class.

By default, PharoJS looks for the `index.html` file in folder `HTML/<yourPackageName>/<yourAppClassName>` in the Git folder of your project.

Otherwise, you are prompted to provide the path, as you've got.

You get a single JS file for your app. It includes all code you are using. Technically, it's possible to generate more than one JS file, but we don't provide support for it. Please share your use case if you feel that it is needed.

When you launch the playground, PharoJS launches the web browser with the app. When you use `PjFileBasedWebApp` it generates the JS file, and opens the `index.html` in the web browser. The generated JS connects to a server on Pharo image running the playground. If no connection is established, the server times out and signals the `Javascript interpreter NOT available` exception.
