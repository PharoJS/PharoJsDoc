# Developing JS Applications with PharoJS

PharoJS allows you to develop JS applications - from the comfort of your Pharo environment. It can support this several ways:

1. PharoJS can export an application to a file ready to be deployed
2. PharoJS can interactively run an application in a browser with interaction via a PharoJS playground
3. PharoJS can run an application within Pharo that interacts directly with the object in a Javascript engine - web browser or NodeJS
