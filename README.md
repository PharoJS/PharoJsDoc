# Documentation for the PharoJS Project

## About PharoJS
[PharoJS](https://github.com/PharoJS/PharoJS) is a system to allow you to develop your code in Pharo using all the tools available in the IDE, including refactoring browsers and playgrounds, and then to be able to deploy your code to a Javascript environment.
PharoJS is released under the [MIT open source License](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). As an infrastructure, PharoJS includes a framework, middleware, and a set of tools. It allows developing and testing applications in Pharo that ultimately run on a javascript interpreter - web browser or NodeJS. It is a general purpose solution. For example, PharoJS can be used to develop client side web applications or cross-platform mobile apps based on solutions such as [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org/).
